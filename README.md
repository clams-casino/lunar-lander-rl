## Lunar Lander



Policy gradient and Deep Q Learning based agents for solving the Lunar Lander Gym environment with discrete action space. The policy gradient agent implements Proximal Policy Optimization for policy optimization and Generalized Advantage Estimation for the score gradient. The Q learning agent implements both Double DQN and Dueling Networks.
